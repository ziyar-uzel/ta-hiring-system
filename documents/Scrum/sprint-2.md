# Sprint 2 (Week 4 to 5)

Scrum master: Nicolas van Schaik

## Tasks Completed

1. Modified schema and design patterns

## Meetings

> We had three meetings during this midterm week sprint to discuss strategy and implementation

### Meeting on 2 December
- Received feedback on the amount of microservices in our project (too many)
- Discussed the need for enough tests
- Discussed details relating to authentication
- Discussed details relating to code clarity

### Meeting on 3 December
- Assigned port numbers for each microservice
- Reaffirmed and distributed work on Task 1 and 2
- Reaffirmed goal of progress on must-have issues for this sprint
- Discussed issue related to API endpoints
- Discussed which microservices to merge based on feedback received on 2 dec
- Discussed the need to make issues more detailed descriptively


### Meeting on 8 December
- Looked at progress regarding Task 1 and discuss potential adjustments of the chosen design patterns
- Discussed two pending MRs
- Appointed new Scrum master
- Discussed the newly announced postponed deadlines and a possible new planning for when to finish the project
- Finalized the dev branch for this sprint
- Pushed to main


## Reflection
## Main Problems Encountered
### Problem 1
**Description:** We didn't push to dev on time (we did it wednesday evening. deadline was wednesday noon) so our TA only had the possibility to review all our work for the previous sprint.
**Solution:** Push to dev by at the latest tuesday so that we are always on time

### Problem 2
**Description:** We had problems understanding each other's work and building forth on it. 
**Solution:** Clear code comments can resolve these clarity issues easily.


## Adjustments for the next sprint:
- Finish pushing to dev for a sprint by wednesday at 14:00 so that TA has enough time to review it and we can push to main on time.
- Add better descriptions to assigned issues to make it more clear to teammates what everyone is working on
- Add enough tests for each microservice
- Try to avoid using @Supress and first try to fix the issue directly. Only use if that fails.
- Add enough comments to your code so that everyone reading it is able to understand it and follow your line of thinking
