Note taker: Michelle Chao Chen\
Date: Thursday 18th November 2021

## Discussion

* Notifications: email or desktop notification, (requires different amounts of work). Scope & skills capable of completing (specific feature). API that gives list of people who have notificatiosns. 
* Email module - integrate into the system.
* Specifications sound like the story - they should be converted to clear requirements. 
* Requirements should be actionable and have a clear definition of done. Can be converted to issues. Define the scope of project. 
* Decide on which features are worth acting on. 
* No visualizations. Visualise the interactions of components of the system (architecture sketch). Specify requirements with diagrams. This can be used along with the requirements. 
* Requirements are not balanced throughout the moscow sections. Different services of one feature can made be part of different parts of moscow. 
* Remove the user story format - break it down, stories are a poor way of expressing requirements. 
* The system "shall" (use this for describing what could be done). 
* For every issue, we estimate hours of work - this can be a measurement for how much work is done by each member. This can be specified on Gitlab.  
* Scrum: for each week, determine a scrum master to organise meeting and agenda as scrum master. 
* A requirement is that the main branch should run
