## Tasks 
(Summarized from the meeting) 
- [ ] BuddyCheck - This is mandatory

- [ ] Complete Assignment 1 (Deadline: 17 December 2021)


## Discussion

* Deadlines: buddycheck (next monday) - not graded
* Assignment 1 is postponed to next week - recommended finish task 1 at the end of this week
* Make sure to implement design pattern (on)
* Next week is final meeting on implementation feedback
* Grace period is extended to after the holidays
* Next week criteria and things need to be fixed. After that, no more feedback. 
* Good distribution of tasks, we need to make sure to keep everyone up to date
* Directory ordering is confusing. Give an outline of the directories and what they are responsible for in the README. Have another look at how everything is organised (low priority)
* George can only look at main. Get the merge request into **12 on Wednesday**. 
* Hard coding the port on the client for making the requests
* Use load balancer in a real submission
* Still only merge after the completion sprint. Instead merging each merge request into main. 
* Explain the suppression and write a TODO for the suppression used. 
* It is a plus to log the meetings
* In the README, should we specify all the paths of each micro service? Yes this will help George check the progress
* Pipeline test coverage should not go down. 
* Its a plus to add things to the pipeline
* Add postman integration tests to the pipeline. Add issues for this addition.
