# Meeting 2 December

Note taker: Michelle Chao Chen\
Scrum master: Nicolas Van Schaik\
Date: Thursday 25th November 2021

## Tasks

- [ ] Write tests for the endpoints implemented from the previous sprint (Move everything with a testing label) 
- [ ] Merge everything into `main` after the final branch of this sprint is merged into `development`
- [ ] Reformat all issues so that they are uniform in structure (determine whether this is necessary)
- [x] Create directory and subdirectory for documents. (Michelle)


## Discussion

* Move code to main the day before the meeting. The course staff run a script (gitinspector) on the `main` branch. 
* Preference: small commits easy to revert. 
* Commits: boiler plate commit, functions, testing, checkstyle/pmd fixes
* Maintain discussions in merge requests (have people involved)
* Keep documents in a specific directory - keep sprint retrospective and the database schema (component diagram)
* Fix commit (code contribution) on the development/main branch before next meeting
* Keep all documents in documents directory - keep email, agenda. Have weekly notes for every sprint (write everythign + meeting we had). Easy to navigate - have subdirectorie. Sprint planning, retrospective, keep track of scrum master + progress. 
* Week 6 is last week for feedback. Week 7 is grace period to make general improvements. 
* Question: experimenting features on repository - permitted to be pushed. You can create a separate issue for this experiment. 
* Review the number of microservice. Likely that two microservice communicate a lot could introduce latency. 
* Document the issues/security problems.
